Design-Patterns-In-Python
=========================

This is the git repository containing the files for a book I am writing. 
This book is all about making reusable elements of software design.

While I started to write this as an e-book, I now think the way to do 
this is write a blog post per design pattern and then compile them into 
a guide. These blog posts can be found [here](http://davidcorne.com/category/design-patterns-in-python/)
